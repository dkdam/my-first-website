# my-first-website
11/10 - Building my first website from everything that I've learnt so far from T.O.P. This project is basically asking me to build a webpage from scratch. As I started on this project. I'm not gonna lie, my head literally went all blank. Everything that I have learnt till now felt like I've known nothing. But as time went by, slowly yet surely I manage to utilise my skills to be able to construct the page pieces by pieces.

12/10 - Continuing on to finish off and polish this project. It took me a while but It is pretty satisifying to be able to build a web page from scratch. To be honest there are bits and pieces that I still need to work on but in general I do get concept of HTML & CSS. It is still pretty fun as I've learnt to figure things it out on my own and suprisingly haven't asked for help yet throughout the course (but will need to ask for help later). As I finished this project through I am now going into javascript and should be getting pretty interesting now.
